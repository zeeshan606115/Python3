Dataclass module is introduced in Python 3.7 as a utility tool to make structured classes specially for storing data. These classes hold certain properties and functions to deal specifically with the data and its representation.

Although the module was introduced in Python3.7, one can also use it in Python3.6 by installing dataclasses library.

pip install dataclasses

The DataClasses are implemented by using decorators with classes. Attributes are declared using Type Hints in Python which is essentially, specifying data type for variables in python.

In dataclasses we have built-in init() method (constructor) so we don't have to define constructor explicitly. It have built-in repr() method. It have built-in eq() method.
